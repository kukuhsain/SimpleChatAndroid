# Simple Chat Android App

Chat apps have been becoming popular nowadays. 
I don't have enough data to say this but I can guess that almost all people which own 
smartphone have chat app(s) in their smartphone.

Imagine that you can implement chat as a feature into your Android app as easy as 
copy-pasting code to your own project.

The code in this repo is free to use and to modify, for non-commercial and commercial projects.
